## Synopsis

The Matterhorn Workflow Browser (WFB) is an interactive d3 based javascript visualization optimized for relative small (a few hundred) chunks of Matterhorn "workflow instances." Users may zoom, pan, and filter by a variety of criteria. Mouse over an element for more information, click on an element to link back to the corresponding page in the Matterhorn admin UI.

The browser accepts Matterhorn workflow endpoint json as input, samples of which may be found in the app data directory. Not that the WFB is a client-side only widget, so the endpoint json will have to be retrieved by an intermediate process that handles authentication, either via a simple cronjob to generate flat files (the way we are currently using it, using pyhorn the last 300 workflows every 10 minutes), or by embedding it in a dynamic webapp (as we plan to).

## Install

Like all javascript projects these days, the WFB uses a shocking amount of scaffolding, inluding grunt, bower and npm (generated by yeoman).



Then plop the contents of the dist directory on your webserver, and diddle with the configuration in index.html as described below.
